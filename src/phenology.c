    There are two phenology schemes currently implemented, one which should
    generally be applicable for deciduous broadleaf forests && one for
    short-lived grasses.

    The tree scheme is based on Botta et al. who calibrated their model against
    EO data. The grasses scheme is really a combination of approaches, I've
    tried to keep it is as simple as possible...user beware :)

    There are some key issues:
     - leaf drop for trees won't work where the daylength isn't applicable, i.e
       the tropics would be my guess.
     - the grass phenology drop takes no account of available water. It of
       course should, but this would need a complete re-write of the logic.
       Perhaps someone else can do that.

    One potential thing to look at if you ever get bored is:

     - Look at Caldararu et al 2014, Phenology as a strategy for carbon
       optimality: a global model. Seems interesting at a quick glance.

    The distribution of C&N is pre-calculated here using a ramping function
    based on leaf out/off dates.

    Finally, no account has been taken for the southern hemisphere! This won't
    work there.
